# Research-Driven Roadmap & Advanced TODOs

## Architecture & Extensibility
- [ ] Refactor event system to be fully event-driven (decouple systems via event manager/observer pattern)
- [ ] Evaluate/experiment with ECS (Entity-Component-System) for businesses, employees, etc.
- [ ] Add plugin architecture for new business types, events, or mechanics
- [ ] Move more game data to external config (JSON/YAML) for easier balancing/modding
- [ ] Modularize simulation logic (distinct subsystems: economy, employees, research, events, customers)
- [ ] Use state machines for business/research/employee processes where appropriate

## Economy & System Balancing
- [ ] Centralize all economic formulas and feedback loops in config or a dedicated module
- [ ] Add exponential/curve-based upgrade and research costs
- [ ] Implement more feedback loops (e.g., reputation affects market, employee morale affects productivity)
- [ ] Add tools/scripts for balancing and simulating the economy outside the main game

## UI/UX & Visualization
- [ ] Add tabbed interface to GUI for business, employees, research, marketing, stats
- [ ] Add data visualization (charts/graphs) for business growth, employee stats, etc. (matplotlib or similar)
- [ ] Improve CLI color coding and menu hierarchy for clarity
- [ ] Add more contextual tooltips and help in GUI
- [ ] Implement detailed statistics/analytics screens

## Save/Load & Data Integrity
- [ ] Add save file versioning and migration support
- [ ] Add save file validation with checksums/hash
- [ ] Support for multiple save slots and autosave
- [ ] Document save format for modders

## Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Profile and batch simulation updates (avoid per-frame recalculation)
- [ ] Use object pooling/flyweight for frequently created/destroyed objects
- [ ] Experiment with async game loop (asyncio) for parallel systems
- [ ] Use NumPy for heavy numerical calculations if scaling up

## Automated Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for all core systems (economy, employees, events, research)
- [ ] Add property-based tests for economic formulas
- [ ] Add automated UI tests (Tkinter and CLI)
- [ ] Mock time-based functions for fast simulation in tests

## Modding & Plugins

- [ ] Expose clear APIs for modders (documented hooks, data formats)
- [ ] Provide example mods and documentation

## Advanced/Innovative Features

- [ ] Add cloud save support (optional)
- [ ] Add procedural content generation (unique scenarios, markets)
- [ ] Integrate pandas for in-game data analysis/visualization
- [ ] Add async/parallel processing for large simulations

## Psychological Engagement & Player Enjoyment
- [ ] Add variable reward systems (random events, rare upgrades, surprise bonuses)
- [ ] Implement milestone achievements and unlocks (e.g., new features, business expansions)
- [ ] Enhance progress feedback: visual (charts, bars), audio (sfx), and narrative (story beats, notifications)
- [ ] Design meaningful choices with real trade-offs (risk/reward, staff vs. morale, investment dilemmas)
- [ ] Layer complexity graduallyâ€”start simple, unlock new mechanics as player progresses
- [ ] Support multiple viable strategies and playstyles (not just one optimal path)
- [ ] Add daily/return incentives (login bonuses, rotating challenges, streak rewards)
- [ ] Integrate narrative hooks (story events, evolving scenarios, character-driven events)
- [ ] Add FOMO/habit features (limited-time events, time-limited opportunities)
- [ ] Provide clear, incremental feedback for every action (stat changes, popups, animations)
- [ ] Implement a system for player agency and experimentation (sandbox/test mode, creative options)
- [ ] Use case study features: e.g., sales/review charts (Game Dev Tycoon), exponential growth (AdVenture Capitalist), creative freedom (RollerCoaster Tycoon)
- [ ] Regularly playtest for fun and engagement, not just balance
